    "\n",
    "Solution- In Python, following certain standards and conventions for variable naming can greatly improve code readability and maintainability. Here are some commonly followed standards and conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "            1. Use descriptive names: Choose variable names that are meaningful and describe the purpose or content of the variable. This helps in understanding the code and its intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "            2. Use lowercase letters: Variable names in Python are typically written in lowercase letters. This is known as the \"lowercase with underscores\" or \"snake_case\" convention. For example: my_variable, total_count.\n",
    "\n",
    "            3. Separate words with underscores: If a variable name consists of multiple words, separate them with underscores for better readability. This enhances the clarity and distinguishes between individual words. For example: first_name, student_age.\n",
    "\n",
    "            4. Avoid single-letter variable names: While single-letter variable names like x, y, or i are allowed, it's generally recommended to use more descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable. This improves code readability and makes it easier to understand the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "            5. Be consistent and meaningful: Maintain consistency in naming conventions throughout your codebase. Use variable names that accurately represent the data they hold or the functionality they support. Avoid generic names like data, value, or temp unless the purpose is clear within the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "            6. Follow the PEP 8 style guide: PEP 8 is a widely accepted style guide for Python code. It provides guidelines for writing clean and readable code, including variable naming conventions. Adhering to PEP 8 can make your code more consistent and easier to understand by other developers.\n",
