    "2.What is an object in Python?\n",
    "An object in Python is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with its own state (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
    "3.What is a class in Python?\n",
    "A class in Python is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior 1  that all objects of that class will share. \n",
    "4.What are attributes and methods in a class?\n",
    "Attributes: These are the characteristics or properties of an object. They represent the data that the object holds.\n",
    "Methods: These are the actions or functions that an object can perform. They define the behavior of the oject.\n",
    "5.What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?\n",
    "Class Variables: These are variables that belong to the class itself, not to individual instances. They are shared by all instances of the class.\n",
    "Instance Variables: These are variables that belong to individual instances of a class. Each instance has its own copy of these variables.\n",
    "6.What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "The self parameter in Python class methods is a reference to the instance of the class that is calling the method. It allows the method to access and modify the object's attributes."
